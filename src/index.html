                    When an amputation is pending, a prosthetist can begin measuring for a prosthetic hand or arm
                    before surgery to expedite production of the prosthesis. Amputations caused by unexpected trauma
                    will require the patient to wait until pain, bleeding, and swelling has subsided and scars have
                    adequately healed.
